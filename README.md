The 1-Click solution to copy folder and document links to the Windows clipboard.

Just like github's "Copy to clipboard" functionality on the right side of this page to copy the git url to the clipboard with a single click!

## Features:

* Configurable as action
* Available as widget
* Document-links will lead to the document's details page
* Folder-links will lead inside the folder within the Document Library
* Multi-language
